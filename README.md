## Overview

This open-source tool provides a 3D visualization of the welding process window (Lobe) for automotive steel grades. It utilizes the **Asari-Rashidi Nugget Growth Model** to predict the relationship between Current, Time, and Force across 2-ply and 3-ply metal stacks.

The app specifically addresses modern automotive challenges, such as:

* **Dissimilar Material Stacks:** Calculating heat generation when mixing Mild Steel with Ultra-High-Strength Steel (UHSS).


* **3-Ply Combinations:** Providing flexibility for complex assembly joins (with an optional 3rd layer).


* **Weldability Safety:** Real-time Carbon Equivalent (CE) monitoring to prevent brittle weld failures.



## Features

* **Dynamic Material Library:** Includes standard grades like JSC270, DP600, DP980, and Boron Steel (Usibor 1500).


* **2-Ply & 3-Ply Modes:** Select "NIL" for the third layer to revert to a standard 2-sheet calculation.


* **Physics-Based Calculations:**
* **Weighted k-Factor:** Adjusts heat generation based on the resistivity and thickness of each ply in the stack.


* **Zinc Coating Factor:** Automatically adjusts contact resistance for GA/GI coated steels.


* **Expulsion Limit:** Predicts the upper boundary of the weld lobe where excessive heat causes metal splashing.




* **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Explore the weldable volume using a Plotly-powered isosurface.
